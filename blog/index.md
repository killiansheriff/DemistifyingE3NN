## Demistifying E(3)-equivariant neural networks!

Welcome to our blog post on demistifying E(3)-equivariant neural networks! This blog aim to introduces the following concepts, in order to understand the mathematical tools leading to learnable equivariant operations:

## Disclaimer

This post serves as an explanation of the paper by ``Geiger et al [1]``. It was written as a final project for the ``Fall 2022 Final Project`` section of the ``6.S898: Deep Learning`` course at the ``Massachusetts Institute of Technology``. Needless to say that the intuition presented herein are heavily influenced by the explanations of Geiger et al.
